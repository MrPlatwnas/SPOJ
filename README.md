Hello! Thanks for reading my solutions I came up with to solve the programming problems at [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/).

My Solutions
============

I have solved the first two problems. I hope my solutions are helpful and well constructed for someone who wants some help with the problems.
If you find any fault in my code please point it to me. Thanks!
I want to solve at least 30-50 problems so I will update my solutions from time to time. Check back again for more solved problems!
